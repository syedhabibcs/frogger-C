Text version of classic game frogger. The goal of game is simple, to get all the frogs home. It might look easy at first but it is very difficult to win. I myself have only won countable times, so you are up. See if you have what it takes!

The game is implemented in C using mutexes and threads. Every individual thread has single task, for example representing frog, handling input, output, lives, logs, etc.
